## Markedstyle

An experiment in quickly prototyping webapps in [Laravel](http://laravel.com), by [Matt Stauffer](http://mattstauffer.co/) of [Good Food Productions](http://goodfoodpro.com/).

**Note:** If I created a fake user account for you in the system because your styles were in Brett's existing Git repo, please email me if you want it taken down or if you'd like to set the email/password for your account for your login. My first name at my company's domain name.
