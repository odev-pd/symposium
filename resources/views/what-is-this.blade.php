    <h1>What is this site?</h1>

    <p>Symposium is an <strong>under-development</strong> site for conference speakers and conference organizers. </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Conference Speakers</h2>
    <p>Symposium helps conference speakers plan and manage talk abstracts, CFP submissions, bios, photos, and speaking schedule.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Talks</h3>
    <p>Track all of your talks, each with one or more versions (e.g. "Professional" vs. "Amateur" for audience, or maybe "Lightning" vs. "Keynote" for length), and each version with a full revision history.</p>
    <p>Look at which version of each talk you submitted to each conference, and how many times each talk has been accepted and rejected.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Bios</h3>
    <p>Store and version multiple biographies for sending in with your talk submissions.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Photos</h3>
    <p>Store multiple revisions of your bio photos, ready to grab and upload with your talk submissions.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Conferences</h3>
    <p>Find which conferences you're interested in applying to speak at; favorite them, track them, and get reminders when their CFP's open and close.</p>
    <p>Track which conferences have accepted or rejected your talk submissions.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Conference Organizers</h2>
    <p>Symposium helps conference organizers receive submissions (by allowing speakers to submit to any conference powered by a CFP platform that's compatible with Symposium--right now we're working toward an OpenCFP integration).</p>
